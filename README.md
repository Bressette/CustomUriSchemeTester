# CustomUriSchemeTester

This repo contains an HTML file that can be used for testing the implementation of a Windows Custom URI scheme to launch a desktop application from a browser. Launching this html file allows you to enter your own url and query parameters which will easily allow you to launch the local application and pass different data on the url. This is helpful for testing that the local registry key works, and for implementing the handling of parameters passed on the url from within a desktop application.
